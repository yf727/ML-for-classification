# Machine Learning and Data Mining Models

This repo includes machine learning and data mining models I implemented in Python and R for CS5800, [CS6930](https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~yzhao/fall2018/CS6930_syllabus.html), GR4058, and [CN229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html), with additional notes I found online. 


## Machine Learning 

ML models implemented and demonstrated in this repo includes: 

1. Maximum Likelihood Estimator
2. Naive Bayes (Maximum A Posterior)
3. K Nearest Neighbors
4. Logistic Regression
5. Linear Regression (L1, L2)
6. Decision Tree
7. Random Forest
8. Clustering: k-means, DBSCAN
9. Support Vector Machine (svm)
10. Perceptron 

## Data Mining 

Models that are mainly for data mining includes:

1. Apriori algorithm
2. FP-tree
3. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
4. Autoregression
